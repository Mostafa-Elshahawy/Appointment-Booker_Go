# Interview-Manager

- Appointment Booking app typically for managers with a lot of appointments throughout the day 
- Used go fiber framework, gorm for database models (ORM) with sqlite, jwt for authentication
- The app has a very simple UI for users written in HTML, CSS and js

  # How the app works:
- The user first identifies the position as there are different pages for each user:
The employees(receptionist or secretary) have more options as they create the appointments
The managers only can see the appointments assigned to them and then react to them by approving, rejecting or updating

- There are also some advanced searching or filtration the user can make like:
showing only the approved appointments, declined appointments
all the appointments from one specific time to another 
all the appointments related to a specific client and more
